# Pandemic — Roles Reference

All 7 roles in the 2013 Revised Edition. Each player receives one role at random during setup.

## Contingency Planner

**Color:** Teal / Cyan

**Special Ability:**
The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from the **Player discard pile** and place it on their role card. This card does not count toward their hand limit. When the stored Event card is played, **remove it from the game** (instead of discarding it).

Only **1 Event card** may be stored on the role card at a time.

**Strategy:** Recovers powerful Event cards from the discard pile for a second use. Particularly valuable in longer games where Event cards may have been played early. Pairs well with any strategy that benefits from repeated event usage.

## Dispatcher

**Color:** Pink / Magenta

**Special Abilities:**
The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
- Move **any pawn** to a city with **another pawn** (does not require card discard).
- Move **another player's pawn** as if it were their own (using that player's cards or the Dispatcher's own cards for Direct Flight / Charter Flight).

When moving another player's pawn with their cards, the other player must agree.

**Strategy:** A powerful support role that enables rapid player positioning. Can unite players for Share Knowledge or rush the Medic to outbreak-prone areas. Excels when the team needs flexible movement across the board.

## Medic

**Color:** Orange

**Special Abilities:**
- When the Medic performs the **Treat Disease** action, they remove **all cubes of a single color** from the city (instead of just 1).
- If a disease has been **cured**, the Medic **automatically** removes all cubes of that color from any city they enter or are currently in — this does not require an action.

The Medic's auto-remove ability does **not** prevent cubes from being placed by outbreaks or infections; it triggers when the Medic moves into or is present in a city. The cubes are removed after placement.

**Strategy:** The most powerful treatment role. Before cures are discovered, the Medic efficiently cleans hotspots. After a cure, they passively clear disease by simply moving through cities. Prioritize curing diseases early to maximize the Medic's passive ability.

## Operations Expert

**Color:** Light Green

**Special Abilities:**
- The Operations Expert may, as an action, build a **research station** in their current city **without discarding a card**.
- Once per turn, the Operations Expert may move from a research station to **any city** by discarding **any city card**. (This is a special move, not a Charter Flight.)

**Strategy:** Provides unparalleled mobility and infrastructure. Building free research stations creates a shuttle network for the entire team. The special move ability makes the Operations Expert highly mobile. Excellent for getting to distant cities quickly and enabling Shuttle Flights for teammates.

## Quarantine Specialist

**Color:** Dark Green

**Special Ability:**
The Quarantine Specialist **prevents** disease cubes from being placed (by both infection and outbreaks) on the city they are in **and all cities connected to it**.

This applies during the Infect Cities phase and during Epidemic card resolution.

**Strategy:** A defensive powerhouse. Position the Quarantine Specialist at high-risk hubs to block infections across multiple cities. Particularly effective in densely connected areas where outbreaks could chain. Works best when placed proactively before epidemics occur.

## Researcher

**Color:** Brown

**Special Ability:**
When performing the **Share Knowledge** action, the Researcher may give **any city card** from their hand to another player in the **same city**. (Normally, the card must match the city both players are in.)

The Researcher can only **give** cards freely — to **take** a card from another player, normal Share Knowledge rules apply.

**Strategy:** Dramatically accelerates cure discovery by passing any needed card to teammates. Pair the Researcher with the Scientist for maximum efficiency — the Researcher feeds cards to the Scientist who needs only 4 to cure. Keep the Researcher's hand stocked with cards of the colors most needed for cures.

---

## Scientist

**Color:** White

**Special Ability:**
The Scientist needs only **4 city cards** of the same color (instead of 5) to perform the **Discover a Cure** action.

**Strategy:** Reduces the card-collection burden from 5 to 4, making cures significantly easier to achieve. Prioritize getting same-color cards into the Scientist's hand. Combines powerfully with the Researcher, who can pass any card regardless of location rules. The Scientist should generally be the primary cure discoverer.
