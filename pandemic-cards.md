## Event Cards (5)

Event cards can be played **at any time** — including on other players' turns and between card draws. Playing an Event card does **not** cost an action. After use, Event cards are discarded (except when recovered by the Contingency Planner, in which case they are removed from the game after second use).

### Airlift
Move **any 1 pawn** to **any city**. (Get a player where they need to be, fast.)

### Forecast
Examine the **top 6 cards** of the Infection deck. Rearrange them in any order and put them **back on top**. (Control which cities get infected next.)

### Government Grant
**Build a research station** in **any city** (no card discard needed, no pawn needs to be there). If all 6 are already placed, you may move one.

### One Quiet Night
**Skip the next Infect Cities phase** entirely. (Play this just before the infection step to buy the team breathing room.)

### Resilient Population
Remove **1 card** from the **Infection discard pile** and place it in the game box (**permanently removed** from the game). This city can never be infected again. (Best used on a city that has caused problems or is highly connected.)

## Epidemic Cards (6 available; 4–6 used per game)

Epidemic cards are shuffled into the Player deck during setup. When drawn, they are **resolved immediately** and then discarded. Drawing an Epidemic card does **not** count as one of the 2 cards drawn — it is resolved and then the player continues drawing.

**Note:** An Epidemic card counts as a drawn card from the deck. If you draw an Epidemic card as your first draw, resolve it, then draw your second card. If both draws are Epidemic cards, resolve each one fully before drawing the next.

### Resolution Steps

#### 1. Increase
Advance the **Infection Rate marker** by 1 space on the track.

#### 2. Infect
Draw the **bottom card** of the Infection draw deck. Place **3 cubes** of the matching color on that city (regardless of how many cubes are already there). If this exceeds 3 cubes of that color, an outbreak occurs. Discard this infection card.

#### 3. Intensify
Take the entire **Infection discard pile**, **shuffle** it, and place it **on top** of the Infection draw deck.

This Intensify step is what makes Pandemic escalate — cities that were recently infected are recycled back to the top of the deck and are likely to be drawn again soon.

## Infection Cards (48)

The Infection deck contains **48 cards**, one for each city on the board. Each card names a city and shows its disease color.

During the **Infect Cities** phase, cards are drawn equal to the current infection rate and 1 disease cube of the matching color is placed on each named city.

The Infection deck mirrors the city card list exactly:

- **Blue (12):** Atlanta, Chicago, Essen, London, Madrid, Milan, Montreal, New York, Paris, San Francisco, St. Petersburg, Washington
- **Yellow (12):** Bogota, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, Khartoum, Kinshasa, Lagos, Lima, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, Santiago, Sao Paulo
- **Black (12):** Algiers, Baghdad, Cairo, Chennai, Delhi, Istanbul, Karachi, Kolkata, Moscow, Mumbai, Riyadh, Tehran
- **Red (12):** Bangkok, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo

## Card Interaction Rules

### Hand Limit
Players may hold a maximum of **7 cards** at any time. Epidemic cards are resolved and discarded immediately (they never stay in hand). If a player exceeds 7 cards after drawing, they must immediately discard or play Event cards to get back to 7.

### Discarding
- City cards are discarded to: perform Direct Flight, Charter Flight, Build a Research Station, Share Knowledge, or Discover a Cure.
- Event cards are discarded after being played (removed from game if recovered by Contingency Planner).
- Epidemic cards are always discarded after resolution.

### Card Trading (Share Knowledge)
- Both players must be in the **same city**.
- The card being exchanged must **match the city** both players are in (exception: the Researcher can give any card).
- Either player may give or take (the acting player spends the action).
- The receiving player must obey the 7-card hand limit.
