In Pandemic, players work as a team of disease-fighting specialists racing to treat and cure four deadly diseases spreading across the globe. Players win by discovering cures for all four diseases before time runs out. They lose if outbreaks spiral out of control, disease cubes run out, or the player deck is exhausted.

## Setup Procedure

1. **Place the board** and put the **infection rate marker** on the first space (2) of the Infection Rate Track.
2. **Place the outbreak marker** on the "0" space of the Outbreak Track.
3. **Place the 4 cure markers**, vial-side-up, near the Discovered Cures area.
4. **Place a research station** in Atlanta (the CDC headquarters).
5. **Place the disease cubes** and remaining research stations nearby as supply.
6. **Shuffle the Infection deck.** Draw and reveal:
   - **3 cards** — place **3 cubes** of the matching color on each city.
   - **3 cards** — place **2 cubes** of the matching color on each city.
   - **3 cards** — place **1 cube** of the matching color on each city.
   - Place all 9 drawn cards face-up in the Infection discard pile.
7. **Give each player a role card and matching pawn.** All pawns start in Atlanta.
8. **Shuffle the 48 city cards and 5 event cards together.** Deal starting hands:
   - 2 players — **4 cards** each
   - 3 players — **3 cards** each
   - 4 players — **2 cards** each
9. **Prepare the Player deck with Epidemic cards:**
   - Divide the remaining player cards into equal(ish) piles matching the difficulty level.
   - Shuffle **1 Epidemic card** into each pile.
   - Stack the piles to form the Player draw deck (do not re-shuffle the combined stack).

## Difficulty Levels

| Level         | Epidemic Cards | Description            |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Introductory  | 4              | Learning the game      |
| Normal        | 5              | Standard challenge     |
| Heroic        | 6              | Maximum difficulty     |

The number of Epidemic cards determines how many piles the Player deck is divided into during setup, directly controlling how frequently epidemics occur.
